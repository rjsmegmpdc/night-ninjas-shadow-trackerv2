/**
 * Streak computation.
 *
 * Counts consecutive days ending YESTERDAY (the most recent completed
 * day) that have at least one qualifying activity. Today is excluded
 * because it's incomplete — the athlete may still train later. Including
 * today as a miss would generate false alarms throughout the day.
 *
 * Alarm logic: if yesterday has no qualifying activity, the streak is
 * "broken" — alarm shows. The count reflects whatever streak was
 * accumulated up to and including the last qualifying day before the
 * break.
 *
 * Mode (governed by setting `streak.run_everyday`):
 *   - false (default): any sport_type counts as a streak day
 *   - true: only Run / TrailRun / VirtualRun count
 *
 * Returns null when there's no activity history at all (don't show
 * the streak counter pre-sync).
