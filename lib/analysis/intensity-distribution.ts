/**
 * Intensity distribution — the 80/20 (Seiler polarised training) check.
 *
 * Computes what fraction of running time was spent at easy intensity vs
 * threshold/V̇O2/repetition. The polarised model says elite endurance
 * athletes spend ~80% of training time at easy intensity, 20% at hard
 * (threshold or above), with very little time in the moderate "grey zone"
 * between.
 *
 * Critically: this is a **running-only** metric. Strength, mobility,
 * cycling cross-training etc. do NOT enter the denominator. The 80/20
 * rule is specifically about the intensity distribution of running.
 *
 * Single number returned per week:
 *   - easyPct: % of running time at easy intensity
 *   - hardPct: % at threshold or above
 *   - greyPct: % at marathon zone (between easy and threshold)
 *
 * easyPct + hardPct + greyPct = 100. The grey zone is named separately
 * because it's where most amateur athletes accidentally live — too hard
 * to be recovery, too easy to drive adaptation.
