            Shadow Tracker pulls your training data from Strava and compares it
            against a real plan — Hansons, Lydiard, or one you build yourself.
            It doesn't just show you what you did. It tells you what you were
            <em className="text-bone"> meant </em>
            to do, what you actually did, and where the gaps are.
          </p>
          <p>
            The job each week is simple: open <Term>Patrol</Term> and see if
            your week is on track. If it isn't, that's information, not
            judgement. Did you ride the pace too fast on Tuesday? Skip
            Thursday's tempo? Cut the long run short? The app tells you.
            What you do with that is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patrol pulls real data — your actual activities are compared
            against the plan engine's prescribed sessions for the current
            week. Wellness markers (sleep, stress, energy) are coming next;
            for now Patrol shows the heart rate and pace trends as your
            best signal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-bone">
            Once a week, open <Term>Recon</Term>. Look at the trends. If you've
            been missing the same session three weeks running, something needs
            adjusting — either your plan or your life.

          <TaskCard title="Your plan isn't matching your reality">
            <p>
              The plan engine reads from your Calendar — races, group runs,
              and commitments all reshape the prescribed week. Two main
              levers if you want to change things:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-bone">If volume is too high</strong>, set
              your weekly cap below the breakdown threshold (Calendar →
              Capacity caps).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-bone">If session structure is wrong</strong>,
              add your real recurring group runs (Calendar → Group Runs). The
              engine will slot them in instead of generic dojo defaults — so
              Tuesday Shoe Science replaces Tuesday speed work.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-bone">If life is in the way</strong>,
              add a Commitment (Calendar → Commitments). The engine scales
              targets accordingly — "Reduced training" halves volume, "Travel
              only" keeps short easy runs and removes long runs, "No training"
              blanks the whole week. Your Patrol header will show what got
              adapted.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-bone">If your goal race is close</strong>,
              the engine automatically tapers — 15% volume reduction in the
              second-to-last week, 30% in race week, with the actual race
              slotted into the right day. You don't need to do anything.
            </p>
          </TaskCard>

          <TaskCard title="You want your full Strava history, not just 90 days">
            <p>
              The wizard pulls 90 days as a starting point. To get the rest,
              go to Settings → Sync Manager → "Pull full history". The job
              runs in the background. You can keep using the app while it
              works.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Strava's rate limit kicks in, the sync pauses automatically
              and resumes once the limit resets (15 minutes). You don't need
              to babysit it.
            </p>

          <TaskCard title="Strava sync got interrupted">
            <p>
              When the dev server crashes, your computer sleeps, or the network
              drops mid-sync, the job is left in a paused state. Next time you
              open Patrol or Calendar, you'll see a banner at the top:
              <em className="text-bone"> Sync paused — resume?</em> Click
              Resume. The job picks up where it left off.
            </p>
          </TaskCard>

          <TaskCard title="An activity got synced wrong">
            <p>
              If you renamed or edited an activity on Strava after Shadow
              Tracker pulled it, trigger an incremental sync from Settings →
              "Sync now". The runner upserts based on Strava activity ID, so
              the existing row will update with the new values.
            </p>
          </TaskCard>

          <TaskCard title="You want to start over from scratch">

          <TaskCard title="Holidays look wrong on the Ninja Loop card">
            <p>
              Calendar → Ninja Loop card → "Refresh from GitHub iCal". Forces
              a re-fetch from the public NZ holidays repo. If a year is
              missing, it's because the source repo hasn't been updated yet —
              the maintainer adds new years annually.
