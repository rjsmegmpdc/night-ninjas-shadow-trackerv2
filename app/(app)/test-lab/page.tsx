      <Notice>
        The automated suite (29 files, 472 tests) covers all pure computation.
        This page covers the <strong>user-visible behaviour</strong> that tests
        cannot reach: syncing from Strava, rendering on real pages, and
        end-to-end flows. Run <code>npm test</code> first — if any test fails,
        stop and fix it before manual verification.
