## Product vision

VELOCITY is an intelligent marathon training console for serious distance
runners. Local-first. Owns its data. Built around a real coach's mental
model - not a logging tool, not a social feed, not a one-shot plan
generator.

> **Rebrand note:** the product was originally *Night Ninjas Shadow
> Tracker*. As of bundle 8074e01+, the user-facing brand is **VELOCITY**.
> The codebase folder, `package.json` name, GitHub repo, and `%APPDATA%`
> data path retain the original name. All UI surfaces show VELOCITY.
> See `BRAND.md` and `DESIGN.md` for the new specs.

The product answers, every day, four questions:

1. **What am I doing today, and why?** - plan + context
2. **How am I tracking against the plan?** - compliance + execution
3. **How is my body, and what's that mean for what I should do next?** - freshness + state
4. **What's coming, and how do I prepare for it?** - countdown + race-execution

Everything we build serves one of those four questions. If a feature
doesn't, it doesn't ship.

---

## Current focus

**Phase R1 - VELOCITY visual rebrand.** The product moved from the
Night Ninjas brutalist aesthetic to the VELOCITY cockpit aesthetic
(rounded-12 cards, 4-item top nav, layered surfaces, semantic teal
alongside accent orange). Documentation foundations landed: DESIGN.md,
BRAND.md, ROADMAP.md updated, README.md updated, Tailwind tokens
extended. Page-by-page restyle is the next session's work.

After R1 (visual rebrand), the planned sequence is:

- **R2** - Surface existing data more visually (Category B from the
  redesign brief): heart-rate zone distribution per session, macrocycle
  phase bar on dojo cards, microcycle preview pane, training load vs
  recovery line chart, monthly volume + delta, last-week adherence chip.
- **R3+** - Original Phase 3b onwards (engine state-awareness, then
  Phase 4-9 per the original plan).

The deferred Category C work (HRV / sleep / RHR / stress / AI Coach /
Garmin-Coros-Apple Health integration) remains on the v2 horizon. Not
in scope for the marathon build.

---

## Done

These are landed. Listed here as ground-truth for what the product
already does, not as celebration.

- 8-dojo plan engine (Hansons, Pfitzinger, Daniels, Higdon, Lydiard, Coogan,
  Furman, Custom) with calendar-aware week rendering
- Goal race + tune-ups, on-demand editable, with target time validation
- Plan-period history (`plan_periods`): each row in the matrix uses the
  dojo and goal that were active at that time, not the currently selected one
- Patrol page hero matrix: 3-week strip (last/this/next) with lazy past
  and forward expansion (8 weeks per page)
- Per-day compliance signals (`hit` / `soft` / `miss` / `planned`) on
  past, current, and future weeks
- Per-week compliance chip with hover-card breakdown
- Streak counter (any-exercise default, run-only opt-in via Settings)
- Race countdown — single line, weeks-emphasis, proximity-aware
- Cross-period dojo-boundary marker on past expansion
- Sync button with auto-refresh on completion
- Activities pull from Strava (incremental + full history); cross-sport
  recognised; gear inventory mirrored
- Multi-activity per day rendering: AM+PM doubles and warmup/workout
  splits show as stacked pills in the cell
- Filter swatches as click-to-toggle filters with CSS-only dimming
- Shoes redesign: table layout, urgency sort, retire-only model
- Theme system (System / Light / Dark) with no-flash pre-hydration
- Calendar holidays (NZ public, personal-day add, individual hide)
- Build infrastructure: idempotent migration runner, comprehensive
  `check.ps1`, externalised JS scripts (no embedded JS in PowerShell)
- **Phase 1: Base-maintenance generator** — engine-agnostic
  `lib/plans/base-maintenance.ts`. Forward-expand populates beyond the
  active program window. Pre-program weeks ramp down from week-1 ×0.85;
  post-program weeks use 4-week chronic load. Floors at 25 km/wk,
  ceilings at chronic × 1.1. Synthesised weeks render with `—  (base)`
  in the W-number column so they're visibly distinct from coached weeks.

---

## Phase R1 - VELOCITY visual rebrand 🟢 SUBSTANTIALLY DONE

The visual rebrand has landed. The product is now VELOCITY in name, top-nav,
wordmark, card system, button system, and palette. Page H1 labels match
the new IA (Dashboard / Methodology / Athlete State / Schedule / Trends /
Equipment / Wellness / Settings / Reference).

**Landed in foundations bundle (73fa351):**
- `DESIGN.md` rewritten for VELOCITY visual system
- `BRAND.md` created with identity, voice, locale defaults
- `README.md` updated with rebrand callout
- `ROADMAP.md` (this file) updated
- Tailwind tokens extended (rounded-xl/lg/2xl, accent-glow, signal-ok teal,
  ink-line-bold, shadow-card variants)
- Top horizontal nav (`components/nav/topnav.tsx`) replaces left sidebar
- VELOCITY wordmark replaces Night Ninjas wordmark

**Landed in restyle bundle (next):**
- Card primitive supports active variant with accent border + inner glow
- `nn-card`/`nn-card-elevated`/`nn-card-active` utilities use rounded-xl + shadow-card
- Button primitive uses rounded-lg, refined variants (primary now accent-fill,
  critical now signal-miss-tinted, outline sits on ink-shadow)
- All page eyebrows updated to new IA labels
- All page H1 titles use new display labels per BRAND.md
- Sidebar component deleted (was unreferenced after layout switch)

**Plumbing landed for R1.5 + 3b:**
- Settings keys: `prefs.coachMode`, `club.parkrun_id`, `club.terms_accepted_at`,
  `club.window_default`, `club.last_share_generated_at`
- TypeScript helpers: `getCoachMode`/`setCoachMode`, club share getters/setters
- Schema: `plan_adjustments` table with `proposed_at`, `applied_at`,
  `dismissed_at`, `trigger`, `rationale`, before/after state, mode, week
- Migration 0006: `plan_adjustments` table created with proposed_at + trigger
  indices

**Still to do as polish (not blocking 3b):**
- Active state on top nav (accent underline on the active bucket)
- Streak chip on top nav showing actual streak count (currently a static icon)
- Avatar dropdown menu (currently a static button)
- Card padding/spacing audit page-by-page
- Mobile responsiveness pass

---

## Phase R1.5 - Club schedule export

Athlete-mediated, manual-step export of upcoming training schedule for
club app consumption. Per athlete's choice (parkrun ID + terms acceptance
+ generate button), VELOCITY produces a JSON file the athlete uploads
manually to the club app. No live API, no webhooks, no scheduled push.

Settings keys + types are already plumbed in. R1.5 builds:
- `lib/club-share/generator.ts` pure function
- `lib/club-share/generator.test.ts` vitest coverage
- `lib/actions/generate-club-share.ts` server action
- `components/club-share/terms-modal.tsx` privacy disclosure
- `components/club-share/generate-button.tsx` action UI
- `app/(app)/settings/club-share-section.tsx` Settings card

Default window: this week + next week (2 weeks). Stripped: completed
sessions (compliance hit or partial), pace targets, HR zones. Window
override at generate-time: 1w / 2w / 4w / next-race / program-end.
Stale warning when last-generated >5 days ago, OR window >50% elapsed,
OR substantive schedule change since last publish.

---

## Phase R2 - Surface existing data visually

Build the "Category B" features the designer's redesign showed us could
exist on top of data we already collect. None of these need new external
integrations.

- Heart-rate zone distribution chart per session (we have HR streams)
- Macrocycle phase bar on dojo cards (BASE/STRENGTH/SPECIFIC) - dojo
  engines compute phase weighting today
- Typical microcycle preview pane on dojo cards (engines compute weekly
  templates)
- Training load vs recovery line chart - we have CTL/ATL/TSB
- Monthly volume stat with month-over-month delta
- Last-week adherence chip with 7-bar visual on Dashboard header

Estimated: 1 session.

---

## Phase R3+ - Resume original roadmap

After R1 (rebrand) and R2 (surface existing data), resume the originally
planned phases starting from Phase 3b (engine state-awareness clamping).
The original numbering below stays the same; R-phases sit above them.

---

## Phase 1 — Forward-week workouts ✅ DONE

**Why this matters now:** the matrix expands forward to race day but goes
empty past the active program window. A 26-week-out goal race with an
18-week program leaves 8 weeks blank. Athletes need to see *something*
for those weeks — and once we have a base-maintenance generator, it's
the foundation for freshness clamping in phase 2.

**Build:**

- `lib/plans/base-maintenance.ts` — engine-agnostic week generator producing
  a sensible default (Mon/Wed/Fri easy, Sun long, Tue/Thu rest with optional
  strength) using current chronic-load floor or a defensible default
- Matrix's row builder uses base-maintenance whenever no period-week applies
- Visual distinction: base-maintenance weeks render with a subtle marker
  ("base") so the runner knows this isn't a coached prescription
- Forward-expand "to race day" populates correctly across the full window

**Deferred from this phase:** none. Crisp scope.

---

## Phase 2 — Athlete state model + intensity diagnostics

**Session A (data layer) ✅ DONE:**

- ✅ Load model — `lib/analysis/load.ts`. Duration × sport baseline ×
  intensity factor → Daniels points. Two-tier resolution: calibrated
  (HR + measured max, OR pace + threshold pace), estimated
  (age-predicted max, or default-easy fallback). Confidence reported
  per activity (`'calibrated' | 'pace-only' | 'estimated'`).
- ✅ Sport-type classifier — `lib/analysis/sport-classifier.ts`.
  Distinguishes Pilates (recognised from activity name when sport_type
  is generic), Yoga, Strength variants, Crossfit, MTB, Trail running.
- ✅ Athlete state model — `lib/analysis/athlete-state.ts`.
  Banister PMC math (CTL τ=42, ATL τ=7, 8-week input window) on the
  load point-stream. Form classification (fresh/on-form/maintained/
  loaded/overreached) using standard PMC TSB thresholds.
- ✅ Intensity distribution — `lib/analysis/intensity-distribution.ts`.
  Seiler 80/20 polarised check, running-only.
- ✅ Mileage progression flags — `lib/analysis/progression.ts`.
  Week-over-week + 4-week mean checks; severity: ok/caution/risk.
- ✅ Long-run proportion flags — same file. % of weekly total + growth
  rate checks.
- ✅ Vitest infra + 33 unit tests covering load math, EWMA convergence,
  form classification, confidence rollup.

**Session B (surfaces) — current focus:**
  - Patrol header: small freshness chip (`fresh` / `on form` / `loaded` /
    `overreached`) next to streak + compliance
  - Patrol body: intensity distribution sparkline below stats row
  - Strike page rebuild: full CTL/ATL/TSB chart, intensity distribution
    history, progression flags, long-run trajectory

**Coach review additions integrated:** intensity distribution (#1),
mileage progression (#2), long-run proportion (#11)

---

## Phase 3b - Engine state-awareness (with three-mode coach setting)

**Why this matters:** state is useless if the prescription doesn't respect
it. Phase 2 reports state; phase 3b makes it actionable. AND it does so
in a way that respects the athlete's preferred level of automation.

**Three coach modes (`prefs.coachMode` setting):**

1. **manual** - engine surfaces insights only. User manually edits plan if
   they want. Insights logged to `plan_adjustments` with applied_at = NULL.
2. **assisted** (default) - engine proposes adjustments. UI surfaces
   "engine recommends: cut Tuesday tempo by 2km. [Apply] [Dismiss]".
   `plan_adjustments` row written on propose; `applied_at` set on accept,
   `dismissed_at` set on dismiss.
3. **automatic** - engine applies adjustments and notifies. Plan changes
   immediately. `plan_adjustments` row written with `applied_at` set.

**Two safety rails (regardless of mode):**

- ACWR breach >1.5 forces a volume cut even in manual mode (it cannot be
  silently dismissed; requires explicit acknowledgement)
- Athlete-logged injuries never trigger any auto-adjust; only the athlete
  updates prescriptions during recovery

**Build:**

- `interpretState(state, phase) -> StateInterpretation` per dojo (8 files)
- `applyAdjustment(template, interpretation) -> WeekTemplate` per dojo
- `prefs.coachMode` setting (already plumbed) wired into engine flow
- `plan_adjustments` table (already migrated) written by every proposal
- Visible "engine adjusted" indicator on Patrol matrix when prescriptions
  differ from the dojo's raw template
- New section in Settings → "Coach Mode" with the three radio options
- Hard ACWR cap implemented as a non-overridable safety floor

**Pre-work recommendation:**

Before commencing 3b's clamp logic, ship engine snapshot tests (one half
session). Each of 8 dojo engines gets a `*.snapshot.test.ts` that runs
`renderWeek` across program weeks 1-18 with various inputs and snapshots
the output. When clamps are added, snapshot diffs catch any regression
in dojos we're not currently dogfooding.

**Override-frequency analysis (deferred to v2):**

The `plan_adjustments` audit table accumulates data starting in 3b. A
v2 feature reads this to personalise thresholds: if an athlete dismisses
volume-cut suggestions 5 times without injury, the threshold loosens for
that athlete.

---

## Phase 3 — Engine consumes athlete state (LEGACY ENTRY)

> Original Phase 3 entry; superseded by Phase 3b above which adds the
> three-mode coach architecture. Kept here for traceability.

**Why this matters:** state is useless if the prescription doesn't
respect it. Phase 2 reports state; phase 3 makes it actionable.

**Build:**

- `renderWeek` signature extended to accept `athleteState`
- `clampForState(prescribedKm, athleteState)` helper per dojo (8 files,
  small change each)
- New plan's first week respects current chronic load (no >10% bump from
  the existing 7-day acute load)
- Mid-block adjustment: when ACWR > 1.3 going into next week, the engine
  recommends a cutback (-15% volume) instead of standard progression
- Patrol shows when the engine has *modified* a prescription, with a
  small "adjusted: high recent load" tag on affected days

---

## Phase 4 — Interruption tracking + injury risk

**Why this matters:** training plans break against life. Right now
calendar holds work/family commitments but nothing else. Injuries are
invisible to the engine.

**Build:**

- New event types in `calendar_events`: `injury` / `illness` / `travel`
  (extends existing `commitment` model)
- Quick-add modal on Patrol matrix (Session B work from prior plan):
  - Single-day click → mark current/upcoming day with type
  - Date range form → multi-day interruption (taper-killing flu, etc.)
- Engine respects: interruption days don't count toward compliance
  failure; freshness calc treats them as zero load
- Matrix visual: interruption days render with a distinct cell pattern
  (diagonal hatching or muted-with-icon) so they're spatially obvious
- **Injury risk chip on Patrol** — composite signal from:
  - ACWR > 1.5 (acute spiking)
  - Cadence drop trend (fatigue indicator already in Strava data)
  - Compliance pattern (athletes often skip Tuesday tempos before
    admitting injury)
  - HRV trend (when phase 6 lands)
  - Self-reported wellness slider (when phase 5 lands)

**Coach review additions integrated:** injury risk modelling (#10), with
the input signals scaling as later phases add data sources

---

## Phase 5 — Athlete profile (calibration + preferences + injury ledger)

**Why this matters:** the engine and freshness model are running on
generic assumptions. The profile is where the athlete tells the system
*who they actually are* — so generic gives way to personal.

**Build:**

- `/profile` route with three subsections:
  - **Body & calibration**
    - Age, weight, height
    - Max HR (measured if known, age-predicted otherwise — clearly labelled)
    - Threshold pace (manual entry or "let me run a 30-min test" CTA)
    - VDOT (computed from race times, displayed as derived)
    - HR zones (auto-derived from max HR, manually overridable)
    - Pace zones (auto-derived from threshold, manually overridable)
  - **Auxiliary work preferences**
    - Strength modality preference: Traditional weights / Pilates / Yoga /
      Mixed / None
    - Per-modality target frequency (1-3 sessions/week)
    - Plan respects: when prescribing a Strength day, label and
      structure it according to preference
    - Distinguish auxiliary types in prescription content:
      "Strength: posterior chain", "Mobility: 20min flow",
      "Plyo: short box jumps + bounding"
  - **Injury & illness history**
    - Ledger: date, type (running-related vs general), description,
      status (resolved / managed / acute), affected area
    - Active issues bias the engine toward conservative prescription
    - Past issues feed a vulnerability score per area (calf, knee, achilles,
      hip, lower back, foot) used by phase 4's risk chip
  - **Daily wellness slider** (optional, lightweight)
    - One-tap morning RPE / sleep quality / energy
    - Surfaces in Strike as recovery proxy
    - Most predictive single metric a runner can self-report

**Coach review additions integrated:**
- Strength modality split (#9) — first-class in this profile
- Running-specific calibration sharpening (#4) — cadence baseline,
  stride-length proxy = `speed / cadence`, running-economy proxy
  (HR at marathon pace)

---

## Phase 6 — Race execution

**Why this matters:** the race is the entire point. The current product
helps you train *for* it then goes silent on race day and after. As a
coach this is the single biggest gap — the product undersells what it's
already done by abandoning the athlete at the moment of truth.

**Build:**

- **Pacing strategy generator** from goal time + course profile
  (course profile: optional manual elevation entry, or pull from Strava
  course/segment data when available)
  - Even / negative / progressive split options
  - Per-5km targets with tolerances
  - Heat / humidity adjustment overlaid (when phase 7 weather is in)
- **Fueling protocol** — calculated from athlete weight, race duration,
  predicted conditions: carbs/hour (g), hydration ml/hour, electrolyte
  targets, gel/drink timing
- **Pre-race carb-loading protocol** — 3-day plan with calorie / gram
  targets keyed off weight + duration
- **Taper view** — automatic surface when within 21 days of goal race:
  - Countdown calendar
  - Daily checklist (sleep, hydration, carbs, last hard session,
    race-pace strides)
  - Confidence-building cues from training history ("your tempo paces
    have improved 12s/km across this block")
- **Post-race protocol** — triggers when goal race date passes:
  - Recovery prescription (no running 5-7d, walking, optional cross,
    then easy reintroduction over 2 weeks)
  - Race debrief input form (time achieved, conditions, RPE, lessons)
  - Lessons logged to journal
  - Prompt to set next goal once recovery period completes
- **Multi-block macrocycle awareness**
  - "This is your 3rd marathon block this year" context on Dojo page
  - Year-over-year self-comparison: "this week last year you ran X km
    averaging Y/km; this week you're at A km averaging B/km"

**Coach review additions integrated:** post-race / multi-block (#5),
race execution (#6), taper view (#8), self-comparison (#16)

---

## Phase 7 — Environmental context

**Why this matters:** a tempo run prescribed at 4:15/km in 28°C humid
conditions is a 4:30/km run in adjusted-pace terms — and the athlete
needs to know that. Without environmental context, compliance scoring
is blind to legitimate reasons sessions look "off."

**Build:**

- **Past activities:** surface temperature/humidity from Strava activity
  data (already there, never displayed). Show on cell drill-down.
- **Compliance heat-adjustment:** when activity occurred in conditions
  warranting adjustment, compliance evaluator uses adjusted-pace targets
  (Daniels' tables for heat/humidity → equivalent sea-level pace)
- **Pre-session forecast:** integrate a weather API (Open-Meteo —
  free, no key required, no cloud OAuth) for the next 7-14 days
- **Forecast on next-week cells:** small temperature glyph on cells
  where forecast suggests pace adjustment will be needed
- **Race day forecast:** as race approaches, show forecast in the
  taper view; pacing strategy auto-adjusts

**Note on local-first:** Open-Meteo doesn't require accounts or keys.
Each forecast is a simple HTTPS GET. Doesn't break the local-first
posture meaningfully — same model as Strava (we already make outbound
HTTPS calls).

**Coach review additions integrated:** heat/humidity adjustment (#7)

---

## Phase 8 — Recovery prescription + session matching

**Why this matters:** rest ≠ recovery, and "planned vs actual on
assigned days" doesn't survive contact with how athletes actually train.

**Build:**

- **Recovery prescription** — rest days in the matrix gain content:
  *"Recovery: 25min Z1 / mobility focus / 8h sleep target"*. Auto-tuned
  to load — heavier days mean stricter recovery prescription on the
  following day.
- **Session matching** — when an actual activity *fulfils a different
  planned slot* than its date suggests, recognise it and adapt:
  *"your Wednesday tempo activity satisfied your Tuesday tempo
  prescription. Wednesday's easy is now satisfied. You're effectively
  a day shifted."*
- **Voluntary swap detection** — athlete-initiated reshuffles within
  a week shouldn't ding compliance
- **Untargeted activities** — categorise activities not matching any
  planned session as "extra" rather than miscounting them as compliance

**Coach review additions integrated:** recovery prescription (#3),
session matching for messy reality (#12)

---

## Phase 9 — Coach voice + reflection

**Why this matters:** information without narrative is just data.
Athletes who reflect on training stay in their plan longer. Pre-canned
coach voice and structured reflection both improve adherence — these
aren't AI features, just behavioural design.

**Build:**

- **Scheduled coach voice** — pre-written messages that fire on
  specific plan-position triggers:
  - First taper week: "Volume drops 20% this week. This feels wrong.
    Trust it."
  - Mid-block fatigue point (typical week 8-10 of marathon block):
    "This is when most blocks feel hardest. Hold the line."
  - Post-missed-Tuesday-tempo pattern: "You missed Tuesday's session —
    here's how to think about that without spiralling."
- **Sunday-night journal prompt** — wire up the existing `journal` table:
  - 3 questions: how did you feel / what worked / what are you uncertain
    about for next week
  - Surfaces in Strike as a longitudinal reflection log
  - Prompts visible on Patrol Sunday afternoon onwards
- **Block-end debrief** — at end of each plan period, structured
  reflection captured to journal, used as context for the next block's
  goal-setting

**Coach review additions integrated:** coach voice (#14), accountability
journaling (#15)

---

## Phase 10 — AI integration (BYOK Anthropic)

**Why this matters:** AI without state is a parlour trick. By this point
we have athlete state, plan-of-record history, freshness, injury ledger,
calibration, race execution context, environmental data. *Now* AI has
something to reason about.

**Architecture:**

- BYOK (bring-your-own-key). User's Anthropic API key, stored in OS
  keychain via `keytar` (same path as Strava credentials)
- Setup flow under `/settings#ai`: key input, validation against a
  small cheap test call, model selection (default Claude Sonnet)
- Privacy posture: every AI request scoped to a single specific question.
  No background uploading. User can see exactly what data was sent for
  each request.
- Cost transparency: each AI feature shows estimated tokens / cost
  before the call

**Build:**

- **Daily briefing** — generated each morning (or on-demand):
  *"Today is your Pilates day. Given yesterday's tempo (RPE 8, HR
  drift suggested under-recovery) and your current freshness (TSB -8,
  loaded), here's a 30-minute flow focusing on hip mobility and
  nervous-system downregulation rather than strength work…"*
- **Plan adjustment recommendations** — when freshness or risk signals
  suggest deviation, AI proposes a specific swap with reasoning
- **Session content generation** — for auxiliary work, generate
  specific session content (Pilates flows, yoga sequences, strength
  routines) tailored to current state and athlete preferences
- **Cell drill-down explanation** — click any cell, get a
  coach-voice explanation of what happened or what's planned and why
- **Race week briefings** — daily AI-generated briefings during taper
  and pre-race, drawing on training history + forecast + state
- **Post-race debrief co-pilot** — AI helps unpack what happened,
  drawing on the training block's data alongside the race-day data

**Why specifically Anthropic for v1:** Matt has Max, the simplest BYOK
path. Plus the API itself supports tool calling, which lets the AI
*ask the app for data* rather than us pre-stuffing context — better for
both cost and relevance. Can add OpenAI / others later via the same
abstraction.

**Coach review additions integrated:** the AI layer is what makes
several earlier coach review items genuinely useful — the coach voice
in #14 graduates from pre-canned to context-aware once this lands.

---

## Phase 11 — Shoe intelligence

**Why this matters:** shoes are tracked but the system doesn't help
the athlete decide *which shoe for which session*. As a coach this is
basic guidance: long runs in cushioned shoes, intervals in racers,
recovery in max-cushion. The data is all there — we just don't apply it.

**Build:**

- **Rule-based shoe-for-session recommender:**
  - Long run → highest-cushion shoe with most life remaining
  - Tempo / interval → daily trainer or racer with sufficient life
  - Recovery → max-cushion / oldest still-safe shoe
  - Race → reserved race-day shoe
  - Trail session → trail-specific shoe
  - Wet/cold conditions → grip-appropriate shoe
- **Recommendations on Patrol:** today's planned cell shows
  *"recommended: Saucony Endorphin Speed (47/180 km left)"*
- **Rotation health:** Strike page surfaces whether the athlete is
  rotating effectively (uses 2-3+ shoes vs single-shoe risk)
- **AI-augmented recommendations** (depends on phase 10): adjust
  recommendations based on injury history per shoe, recent niggles,
  weather forecast

**Coach review additions integrated:** shoe-for-session (#3 from your
original brief; #15 here mostly), with AI escalation in phase 10

---

## Phase 12 — External data sources (cloud OAuth)

**Why this matters:** sleep and HRV are the highest-leverage signals
we don't currently capture. They genuinely require cloud OAuth — there's
no local-first version.

**Build (sequenced by integration cost):**

- **Apple Health** (HealthKit via shortcuts export, user-controlled)
- **Garmin Connect** (OAuth)
- **Whoop** (OAuth)
- Pull: HRV, RHR, sleep duration, sleep quality
- Surface in Strike as recovery state inputs to freshness model
- Surface on Patrol as small chip when concerning trends emerge
- AI integration (depends on phase 10) draws on these signals for
  daily briefings and plan adjustments

**Local-first compromise:** these are explicitly cloud-dependent. The
posture is "local-first by default, cloud capabilities only when the
user opts in per-source, with clear data-flow disclosure."

---

## Phase 13 — Race fueling specifically (not full nutrition)

**Why this matters:** full nutrition logging is hugely expensive and
modestly useful. But race fueling is a *calculation*, not a log, and it
materially affects race outcomes. Worth surfacing as a focused capability.

**Build:**

- **Long-run fueling protocol** — calculated from weight + duration:
  carbs/hour, hydration ml/hour, electrolyte targets
- **Race-week carb-load protocol** — 3-day plan, gram targets
- **Race-day fueling plan** — gel/drink timing, calculated for race
  duration with conditions overlay
- Lives in Patrol's race-execution surface (phase 6) and gets enriched
  by AI (phase 10) for personalised tweaks

**Explicitly out of scope:** food diary, daily macro tracking, meal
logging. Those belong in a nutrition app, not a training app.

**Coach review additions integrated:** race fueling (#13)

---

## Phase 14 — Dojo maintenance + customisation

**Why this matters:** static dojos drift from the latest research. As
the product matures, this becomes a real strategic question.

**Build (when the time comes):**

- Dojo-tuning interface: athlete can adjust mileage caps, long-run
  caps, intensity distribution within a dojo's framework
- Versioned dojo files with update mechanism
- "Dojo authoring" mode for coaches to define custom dojos
- Optional: subscription tier for community-maintained dojo updates

**Coach review additions integrated:** dojo maintenance question (#17)

---

## What's explicitly out of scope (for now)

These have been considered and deliberately not put on the roadmap.

- **Social features.** The product is local-first by design. Cloud
  social features fundamentally break that.
- **Live activity recording.** Strava (and Garmin and Coros) do this
  better than we ever will. We consume their output.
- **Daily nutrition logging.** Race fueling yes (phase 13). Tracking
  every meal: no.
- **Live coaching marketplace.** The dojos are methodology; we don't
  intend to broker human coaches.
- **Marketing-style content.** The voice we've developed (Sinek-influenced,
  punchy, defensible metrics) doesn't extend into "10 tips to crush
  your next race." That's a content business, not a product.

---

## Done definition for "v1"

A serious distance runner can:

- Set a goal race + tune-ups, pick a dojo, get a plan that respects
  their current state (✓ now / ⏳ phase 3)
- See where they are against the plan, including environmental + life
  context (⏳ phases 2, 4, 7)
- Get tactical race-execution support (pacing, fueling, taper, post-race
  recovery) (⏳ phase 6)
- Have an AI coach available for context-aware questions and daily
  briefings, paid via their own API key (⏳ phase 10)

Phases 1-7 + 10 are the v1 commit. Phases 8-9 + 11-13 are the v1.1
commit. Phase 14 is post-v1.

## Update protocol

When a phase lands:
1. Move its bullets to the Done section above
2. Update "Current focus" line at the top
3. Tick off any phase entries it completes; if a phase wasn't fully
   landed, list what's still pending under the next-current-focus phase
4. Note any roadmap revisions discovered while building (real builds
   teach the roadmap things)
